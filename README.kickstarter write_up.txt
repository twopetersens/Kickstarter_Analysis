# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Many organisations and individuals launch Kickstarter campaigns to raise funds in order to finance projects. There are a significant number of variables that influence the success of such a fundraiser, and identifying significant timing and funding requirements is key to having a successful campaign.

### Purpose

The intent of this project was to show differing correlations between Kickstarter funding requirements, dates of submission, and the resulting success or failure of the fundraising.

## Analysis and Challenges

Overall, the data sample available implies that there is a distinct correlation of success tied to the amount of funding requested and the "timing," i.e. the time of year the fundraising is held, and the amount of money requested for the project.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Launch your campaign early spring to mid summer. Or cross your fingers and hope to hit that October Oscar rush.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Based on the data available, fundraising goals are met hexagonaly, meaning, the lower the target, fundraising sees a higher distribution of met goals v. lower; mid distrtibution shows a wider failed range than success, and the largest goals show a greater disparity in fail/success. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Shoot low and early, meaning, keep your fundraising goals low to reasonable based on the ideal production, and begin fundraising begining late April, early May. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Monetarily reasonable goals met with winter thaw will be your win. That's a fortune I just made up. Thanks. You can use it.

Lower requested funding shows the greatest potenetial of goal attainment. Shoot low, attain capital.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Same as all limitations; reporting bias, lack of control group, irregularity in reporting, etc. The largest limitation is no reporting on sustained success.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Data that can correlate goal raising, when requested, and LONGEVITY of the project. A data point that shows some type of value in the fundraiser succeeding while corresponding to fundraising goals and the time of year the fundraising began.
